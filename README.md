# ARC-Prize-2024
•	Developed an AI model for the ARC Prize 2024 competition to solve abstract reasoning tasks.
•	Created algorithms to detect and learn patterns from training data, enabling the model to handle new, unseen problems.
•	Implemented methods to analyze and understand transformations between input and output grids, such as object detection and background color analysis.
•	Integrated Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance pattern recognition and reasoning capabilities, bridging gaps in understanding complex transformations.
•	Used Python libraries (NumPy, Pandas) and JSON for data processing and transformation.
•	Validated model accuracy through rigorous testing against known outputs, achieving high accuracy.
•	Leveraged Google Colab for efficient model training and testing with GPU support.
•	Optimized model performance by implementing grid search and hyperparameter tuning, improving efficiency and accuracy.
